Home Security System Using Arduino 

### ABSTRACT

Internet of Things (IoT) is the idea of remotely connecting and monitoring real-world objects (things) through the Internet. When it comes to our surroundings, this idea can be used to make them smarter and secure.
Home security is one of the major applications of the internet of things. However, the current systems are expensive due to the complexity of the device. In this project, we will attempt to design a cost-effective security system for use in homes as well as industrial areas such as banks. 
The system will use sensors to detect the presence of humans or animals, flame or smoke in the vicinity. This system can also detect if any burglar breaks in through the door. If anything is detected it will send a notification to the user's phone so that the user can take the required steps. This system uses an Arduino Uno board as an interface between the components and a SIM900A to send messages to the user's phone. The main advantages of such a system are the low cost, low maintenance, and ease of set up.

### INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things has been gaining a lot of popularity in the past decade, growing tremendously across various fields such as Agriculture and Health. The Internet of Things is found everywhere, from parking lots to your home, and has made its impact all across the globe. Not only is IoT required to control objects, but it also provides timely updates of the current situation, for instance, weather reports. Using the online IDE to compile makes developing IoT based projects simple and time-efficient.
One of the main aims of every human being is to provide basic protection to their family. As technology advances, security has become a major threat. Securing our houses has gained major importance in the past years. As crime rates increase, our major priority should keep ourselves secure. Home security has been drastically modified in the past years and will keep evolving to adapt to future requirements. There has been an increase in the growth of the number of sensors and devices being connected to the Internet in these past years. This is why it is beneficial to use the existing infrastructure for designing the proposed security system. An alarm system is a requirement when the user is present but when the user is not at home, the alarm system is not very useful. Through IoT, we can alert the user during intrusion breakage by sending messages to the user's phone. The sensors are used to detect the motion of intruders and forceful entry through the doors. 
Home security isn't restricted to intrusion alerts alone, but can also include gas and fire detection. Most of the time, we don't detect gas leakage and fire until it's too late. Using this device, we can protect ourselves from these major threats. Due to the development of IoT, various sensors can be connected to the microcontroller to enhance the system.
