Home Security System Using Arduino 

### ABSTRACT

Internet of Things (IoT) is the idea of remotely connecting and monitoring real-world objects (things) through the Internet. When it comes to our surroundings, this idea can be used to make them smarter and secure.
Home security is one of the major applications of the internet of things. However, the current systems are expensive due to the complexity of the device. In this project, we will attempt to design a cost-effective security system for use in homes as well as industrial areas such as banks. 
The system will use sensors to detect the presence of humans or animals, flame or smoke in the vicinity. This system can also detect if any burglar breaks in through the door. If anything is detected it will send a notification to the user's phone so that the user can take the required steps. This system uses an Arduino Uno board as an interface between the components and a SIM900A to send messages to the user's phone. The main advantages of such a system are the low cost, low maintenance, and ease of set up.
